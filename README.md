## 🧪 Usage

### 1. Upload Resume

- Users upload a `.pdf` or `.docx` resume.
- Backend parses resume and extracts relevant topics.

### 2. Question Generation

- Inferenced LLM generates customized interview questions.
- Questions are stored in the Supabase DB.

### 3. Mock Interview

- User joins live interview simulation.
- Audio (Whisper) and video (MediaPipe) are analyzed.

### 4. Scoring

- Evaluates answers based on keyword match and confidence score.
- Scores are logged and visualized on the dashboard.



## ⚙️ How It Works

| Component            | Description |

| **Resume Parser**    | Extracts keywords and domains from uploaded resumes. |
| **Question Engine**  | Uses LLM-based prompts to create questions. |
| **Interview Module** | Frontend component handles video/audio capture. |
| **Evaluation Engine**| Uses Whisper for transcription and MediaPipe for confidence. |
| **Feedback**         | Combines answer accuracy + confidence score to generate insights. |
